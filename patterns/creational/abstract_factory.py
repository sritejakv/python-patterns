:source https://github.com/faif/python-patterns/blob/master/patterns/creational/abstract_factory.py
:description In Java and other languages, the Abstract Factory Pattern serves to provide an interface for
creating related/dependent objects without need to specify their
actual class.

The idea is to abstract the creation of objects depending on business
logic, platform choice, etc.

In Python, the interface we use is simply a callable, which is "builtin" interface
in Python, and in normal circumstances we can simply use the class itself as
that callable, because classes are first class objects in Python.

This particular implementation abstracts the creation of a pet and
does so depending on the factory we chose (Dog or Cat, or random_animal)
This works because both Dog/Cat and random_animal respect a common
interface (callable for creation and .speak()).
Now my application can create pets abstractly and decide later,
based on my own criteria, dogs over cats.
